# Nehiyawewin-Keyboard
A Linux Keyboard layout for Plains Cree/ Nêhiyawêwin

# Example



# Installation:

To Install the keyboard, add it ~/.config/xkb/symbols

Depending on your compositor / window manager you might need to rename the layout to "custom" and see if it shows up in your desktop's keyboard settings

# Windows/MacOS Support:

I will not be supporting windows or macos with this project. My older archived keyboard repository should suit your needs however.
